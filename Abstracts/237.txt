improved time series classification with representation diversity svm time series classification machine learning time series representation time series classification time series classification an important task data mining that been traditionally addressed with use similarity based classifier nn dtw typically considered most accurate model temporal data nevertheless some author recently proposed ingenious alternative nn dtw by using diversity time series representation or by using dtw feature extraction this paper explore diversity time series representation distance function obtain distance feature which turn used train an svm model argue that scientific community largely neglected vast body unconventional distance function present empirical evidence that distance feature better than nn dtw with respect classification accuracy
