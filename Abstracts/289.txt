comparing gaussian mixture model hidden markov model classify unique physical activity from accelerometer sensor data accelerometer wavelet pca gmm hmm confusion matrix with recent interest physical therapy through sufficient physical activity considerable effort been made monitor classify daily human activity especially people who need physical rehabilitation our previous study designed classifier identify unique physical activity performed by healthy participant between age this study with use geneactiv accelerometer monitor wide range daily activity present learning approach identify unique activity performed by varied group participant with various health condition dataset comprised senior participant participant who significantly taller height than general population performing unique activity extracted different feature time frequency domain selected most efficient feature with sequential forward selection algorithm with two stage classification first utilized combining similar class second determines final decision tested two classifier our learning approach gaussian mixture model gmms hidden markov model hmms compared their performance improved gmm classifier from our previous study it shown more promising result this dataset achieved an accuracy when classifying unique activity with gmm with hmm when classifying activity
