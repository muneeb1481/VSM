parallel medoids algorithm clustering based mapreduce medoids canopy algorithm max min distance algorithm mapreduce medoids algorithm partition based algorithm which characteristic simple implementation strong robustness high accuracy however it some disadvantage such strong dependence selection initial center unknown number classification high resource cost frequent iteration algorithm poor clustering effect mass data order solve these problem original medoids algorithm wa improved by introducing canopy algorithm max min distance algorithm point were selected initial center cluster era big data use mapreduce computing framework parallelize algorithm experimental result show that improved clustering algorithm not only good speedup but also improves clustering accuracy convergence show large performance advantage dealing with large scale data
