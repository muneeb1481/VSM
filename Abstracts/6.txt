high precision screening android malware with dimensionality reduction dimensionality reduction mobile security android principal component analysis this work present new method classifying previously unseen android application malware or benign algorithm start with large set feature frequency possible byte sequence application byte code principal component analysis applied that frequency matrix order reduce it low dimensional representation which then fed into any several classification algorithm utilize implicitly restarted lanczos bidiagonalization algorithm exploit sparsity gram frequency matrix order efficiently compute low dimensional representation when trained upon that low dimensional representation several classification algorithm achieve higher accuracy than previous work
