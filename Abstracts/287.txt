norm principal component analysis via bit flipping anomaly detection data contamination genomic data norm norm principal component analysis outlier singular value decomposition subspace learning norm principal component pc data matrix found optimally with cost nk general case rank when rankx constant with respect certainly real world application where large even latter polynomial cost prohibitive this work present bf novel near optimal algorithm that calculates pc with cost ndmin dk dnk comparable that standard norm principal component analysis our numerical study illustrate that proposed algorithm attains optimality with very high frequency while same time it outperforms pca metric any counterpart comparable computational cost outlier resistance pc calculated by bf documented with experiment dimensionality reduction genomic data classification disease diagnosis
