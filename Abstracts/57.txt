switch restart algorithm with exponential restart strategy objective selection it runtime analysis runtime analysis objective selection algorithm selection online selection ea rl there exist optimization problem with target objective which optimized several extra objective which may or may not helpful optimization process this paper considers case when it possible find an optimum target objective by optimizing either target objective or single extra objective an algorithm presented that us single instance an underlying single objective optimization algorithm optimize different objective different iteration restarts optimization algorithm between optimizing different objective this algorithm expected running time most min until an optimum target objective found where expected running time underlying optimization algorithm find an optimum target objective by optimizing objective an impact not using restarts between iteration also discussed
