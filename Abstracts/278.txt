density based data pruning method deep reinforcement learning correlation stability analysis learning artificial intelligence training road index standard present density based data pruning method deep reinforcement learning drl improve learning stability long term memory rare situation method control density distribution experience pool by discarding high correlation data preserving rare unique data apply our method deep network dqn deep deterministic policy gradient ddpg testing discrete continuous action space respectively evaluate our method path following task simulated physical environment compared other conventional method such first first out fifo our method provides significant improvement performance learning stability average cumulative reward increased by standard deviation cumulative reward over multiple trial reduced by addition long term memory improvement shown agent remember perform behavior corresponding past rare event
