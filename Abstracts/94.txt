automatic gender classification system from finger ratio comparison success with using different algorithm classification algorithm mass death automatic gender estimation index ring finger ratio high rate correctness information determining identity corps mass death such disaster aircraft high speed train or sea accident fire where people damaged an extent that they can not identified method followed main element this study dataset wa formed by taking index finger ring finger height age turkish men turkish woman dataset wa used identifying sex person thus information that could reveal identity information wa obtained lad tree algorithm naive bayes algorithm knn algorithm algorithm were tried datasets algorithm highest rate success determining sex with rate therefore automatic sex classification wa made using algorithm study revealed that ratio varies different sex race moving from these study sex wa determined from ratio index finger ring finger when compared with existing study literature different race it wa proved that race also determined it wa found that left hand provided higher success finger ratio use identifying sex compared right hand
