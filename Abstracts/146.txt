online learning algorithm collective lda topic model online learning variational inference multi corpus data mining collective latent dirichlet allocation lda proposed an extension lda simultaneously model multiple corpus from different domain order overcome bias individual corpus however with large volume document collection from various source it becomes challenging achieve fast convergence lda high time complexity lda limit it application real world task luckily online learning shown promise speeding convergence lda this paper propose explore online learning collective lda ovclda first develop an efficient variational inference algorithm collective lda then extend it online learning framework perform experiment with various real world corpus experimental result shown that ovclda learn comparable topic with lda better than online lda achieves comparable computational efficiency with online lda much more efficient than lda
