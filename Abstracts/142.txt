transfer learning air combat behavior reinforcement learning transfer learning air combat training simulation computer generated force machine learning technique help automatically generate behavior computer generated force inhabiting air combat training simulation however complexity scenario increase so doe time learn optimal behavior transfer learning potential significantly shorten learning time between domain that sufficiently similar this paper transfer air combat agent with experience fighting versus scenario various versus scenario performance transferred agent compared that agent that learn from scratch scenario experiment show that experience gained scenario very beneficial plain scenario where further learning minimal difficult scenario transfer also occurs further learning ensues result pave way fast generation behavior rule air combat agent new complex scenario using existing behavior model
