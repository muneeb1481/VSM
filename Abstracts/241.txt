inferring hearing loss from learned speech kernel acoustic feature learning clustering tuning curve bandwidth equal loudness contour audiogram doe hearing impaired individual speech reflect hearing loss if it doe nature hearing loss inferred from speech investigate these question least four hour speech data were recorded from each adult individual both male female belonging four class normal severely profoundly hearing impaired with high medium or low speech intelligibility acoustic kernel were learned each individual by capturing distribution speech data point represented m duration window these kernel were evaluated using set neurophysiological metric namely distribution characteristic frequency equal loudness contour bandwidth value tuning curve our experimental result reveal that hearing impaired individual speech doe reflect hearing loss provided loss hearing considerably affected intelligibility speech such individual lack tuning any frequency range inferred from learned speech kernel
